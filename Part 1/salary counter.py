# Write a Python program to compute and display a personâ€™s weekly salary as determined by the following conditions:
# If the hours worked is less than or equal to 40, then the person receives Tk 200 per hour.
# If the hours worked is greater than 40, then the person receives Tk 8000 plus Tk 300 for each hour worked over 40 hours.
# The program should request the hours worked as an input from the user and display the salary as output. 
# You need to make sure that user input is valid. For example, a person cannot work for -5 hours or more than 168 hours in a week.
# So, the valid hours range is 0 to 168

x=int(input('Enter hours: '))
if x<=0 or x>168:
    print('Invalid hours')
else:    
    if x<=40:
